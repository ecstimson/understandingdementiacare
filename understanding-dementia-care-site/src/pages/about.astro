        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl md:text-4xl text-stone-800 mb-12 text-center leading-tight">
          "I didn't understand that she had dementia. <br/>And I didn't understand what dementia was all about."
        </h2>
        
        <div class="font-light text-stone-600 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-8">
          <p>
            When my 87-year-old mother started showing signs of dementia, I refused to see it.
          </p>
          <div class="pl-6 border-l-2 border-stone-300 space-y-4 italic text-stone-700">
            <p>When she became forgetful, I was impatient.</p>
            <p>When she made mistakes, I was critical.</p>
            <p>When she was confused, I was insistent.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I argued, I nagged, I quizzed, I corrected…and I made things worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't because I didn't love Mom – I did, very much. We had a wonderfully close relationship. It wasn't because she was being stubborn or ornery or ugly. She wasn't. She had always been sweet and loving, and still was.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't because I didn't care. I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            No – it was because I didn't understand. I didn't understand what was happening to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I got it, once I learned what could change, things went much better for us.
          </p>
          <p class="font-serif text-xl text-stone-900 pt-4">
            So that's what I do now. I help other caregivers, family members, and staff to have those lightbulb moments. I help them learn that there IS a better way to live with dementia. I help them to understand.
